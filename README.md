# Swara

Swara is a journaling app, which helps you record your thoughts while providing the ability to interact with GenAI based on these thoughts.

## Highlights
- Only Audio input
- Journal mode: Only the audio is recorded and transcribed in this mode, without interrupting your flow with GenAI responses. 
- Discuss mode: The input audio is recorded, transcribed and sent to GenAI api along with the previous conversation history. Because of the history, this can be used as a assistant/coach as well as a search tool.
- Use your own API key: The application requires an openai platform key, with credits added to the account. 
- Privacy: There is no app backend apart from GenAI apis used. Your data is stored only on your phone, and will be deleted when the app is deleted.

## Downloading the app for Android
